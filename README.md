This project involve steps such as Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis , Data Mining process, implement various algorithm to decide which produce the best accuracy score. This also involve multiple iterations to improve accuracy score and obtain a decision in relation to the objective. This is done using Spyder (Iteration 3) and PySpark (Iteration 4)
